## Description
A scaled down clone of Slack for learning and practice purposes, built with React.js.
Technologies used include React.js, Redux (with redux-toolkit), Styled-components, Firebase (Google authentication, Firestore DB, hosting).
- Redux offers global state management (data layer) which eliminates the need for prop drilling to multiple child components. Data can be readily available to many child components.
- Styled-components enables the developer to better reuse components in larger builds, which adds consistency to the codebase.
- Firebase serves as the backend of the app, with authentication, firestore database and hosting provided as a whole.
- 
The user can login with their Google account. Once logged in the user can select or add a slack room and start chatting with other members.
